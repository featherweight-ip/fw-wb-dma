// DMA engine / data mover -- the one runnable in the model. It owns the engine's
// EDGE ports (two master memory interfaces + the interrupt sink + per-channel HW
// handshake) and runs the service loop: pick a ready channel, transfer one chunk
// through the fw_mem_if master ports, update the channel's working/status state,
// and raise interrupts. One pass services one chunk and then re-arbitrates (spec
// §3.2.1/§3.2.2 per-chunk re-arbitration).
//
// Arbitration is register-centric: readiness and priority come straight from the
// channel CSR fields (busy/stop/err/prio) plus the global PAUSE, so the engine
// arbitrates locally -- no separate arbiter object. An HW-handshake channel is
// additionally gated on a pending request: it is "ready" only once its device has
// asserted dma_req, so a stalled HS device never blocks service of other channels
// (no head-of-line blocking -- the engine never commits to a channel it would
// then block inside).
//
// When nothing is ready the engine does not spin on a delay. It names the set of
// things it waits on as one `fw_event_set` (m_wake) -- a HETEROGENEOUS set of
// `fw_awaitable_if` event sources: every CSR (a host write produces into it) plus
// every connected HS port (a dma_req produces into it). The wait site is simply
// m_wake.wait_any() (a single @event, O(1)). Sources PUSH their "event occurred"
// into the set, so there is no per-wait fork; this produce/monitor split is what
// lowers to RTL (the set's event is the OR of its members' fired pulses, and the
// wait site is a process sensitive to it).
//
// The engine speaks the Wishbone access API (wb_proto_if) on its master ports;
// the signal-level transactors at the module boundary bridge that to WB pins.
