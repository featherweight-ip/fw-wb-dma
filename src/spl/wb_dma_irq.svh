// Interrupt propagation -- the model component that turns the DMA's interrupt
// state into the two aggregate level outputs. It lives INSIDE the model (a child
// of wb_dma) and knows only the abstract gpio_drive_if edge (from fw.proto.gpio's
// API layer) -- never a transactor; the signal-level GPIO initiator is instanced
// only at the wb_dma_spl module boundary and bound to irq_a/irq_b there.
//
// LEVELS vs CAUSES. The engine's de.irq port publishes per-channel CAUSES to an
// optional external scoreboard (spec/design-doc split). The two LEVEL outputs are
// a separate concern: inta = |(INT_SRC & INT_MSK_A), intb = |(INT_SRC & INT_MSK_B)
// (spec S4.2-4.3), evaluated by rf.inta()/intb(). This block owns the levels and
// is driven entirely off rf -- it does NOT consume de.irq, so de.irq stays free
// for a cause scoreboard.
//
// That level expression moves on exactly three events, all of which reach rf and
// are published on its wb_dma_int_if seam (int_changed) -- this block's single
// wake source:
//   * the engine flagged an irq-worthy event  (rf.raise_int -> a source is SET),
//   * an INT_MSK_A/B write                     (re-routes the aggregate), and
//   * a channel-CSR read                       (read-to-clear -> the deassert half).
// int_changed() only WAKES (sets m_dirty); the aggregate is read ONCE, in run(),
// from rf -- so the masking lives in exactly one place. wait(m_dirty) is level-
// sensitive, so a wake landing between evaluate and wait is not lost.
//
// The level outputs are OPTIONAL: an integration that consumes only causes (the
// raw-model smoke/perf benches) leaves irq_a/irq_b unbound, and run() is inert.
