// ---- the seam between the generated operation model and this testbench -----
//
// `wb_dma_c_pkg` (generated from src/pss by `pss.op-model-sv`) is a programming
// API with one hole in it: the import interface. It says WHAT accesses the
// device needs and leaves HOW to the integration. This class is the how.
//
// WHY IT DELEGATES TO THE SEQUENCE rather than driving the bus itself. Every
// register access in this bench already goes through
// `wb_dma_base_seq::reg_write`/`reg_read`, and three things ride on that path:
//
//   * the accesses land on ONE sequencer (`env.m_init.m_seqr`), so they keep a
//     single order relative to each other;
//   * on the TLM top, `wb_dma_reg_tee` fans each access out to the always-on
//     reference model, so the reference is programmed identically; and
//   * on the signal tops, `wb_dma_reg_forward` replays the observed cycles into
//     the reference instead.
//
// An adapter that drove its own transactions would have to re-derive all of
// that, and would interleave unpredictably with any sequence still using raw
// register writes -- which, during the migration, is all of them. Delegating
// gets it for free.
//
// The cost is that the adapter is bound to a RUNNING sequence: `seq` is set by
// `wb_dma_base_seq::pre_body()` and is only valid while that sequence is
// running. The `wb_dma_c` handle it builds outlives sequences, which is why the
// handle lives here and not on the sequence.
//
// Design: docs/uvm-op-layer-adoption.md §6.1.

    // ---- completion accounting -------------------------------------------
    //
    // The operation layer never reads INT_SRC -- `probe_status()` reads the
    // channel's own CSR and decodes err/done from it. So `note_int_src` (already
    // a no-op on every flavour) stays dead, and `note_ch_status` -- which is
    // what fills `irqc.n_done` / `done_order` on the WB and RTL views, and what
    // the scoreboard's check_done_count() consumes -- has to be fed from here
    // instead of from wb_dma_base_seq::ack_int.
    //
    // A sequence still using raw reg_write/reg_read keeps feeding the hooks
    // through wb_dma_base_seq::ack_int instead; the two never see the same CSR
    // read, so they cannot both count one completion.
    //
    // ---- WHY THIS IS EDGE-DETECTED, WHICH THE DESIGN MISSED ---------------
    //
    // `note_ch_status` counts COMPLETIONS. The CSR reports a LEVEL, and the two
    // are not the same thing here because DONE and INT_DONE are different bits:
    //
    //     bit 11  done       status: the transfer finished
    //     bit 21  int_done   interrupt source, cleared by reading the CSR
    //
    // Reading CH_CSR clears the interrupt SOURCE bits. It does not clear the
    // STATUS bits, which hold until the channel is re-armed -- and
    // `wb_dma_wb_model::note_ch_status` decodes csr[12]/csr[11], the status
    // pair.
    //
    // That was invisible while `ack_int` was the only reader: it read each
    // channel's CSR exactly once per interrupt, so one completion produced one
    // read produced one count. The operation layer reads the same register
    // several times per transfer -- `write_field(ch_en)` is a read-modify-write,
    // and `probe_status()` re-reads on every wake -- so forwarding every read
    // counted one completion two or three times. It showed up as
    // "done-interrupt count 2 != expected 1" on the wb and rtl views; the TLM
    // view was silent, because there `note_ch_status` is a no-op and irqc is
    // fed from the engine's own cause seam.
    //
    // So the latch below reports the 0->1 edge of a terminal status, once per
    // arming. It is cleared by the ARM (a CSR write with ch_en set) rather than
    // by observing done go back to 0: after a completion the status stays set
    // until the next arming, so waiting to see a zero would either miss the
    // next completion or race with a transfer fast enough to finish before the
    // first poll.
