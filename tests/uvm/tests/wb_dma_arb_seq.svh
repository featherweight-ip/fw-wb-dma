// ---- 4-channel priority arbitration sequence -----------------------------
// All channels copy an equal block (mode 0->0, distinct regions) but at
// distinct priorities; the engine must complete them highest-priority-first.
//
// Driven through the generated operation model. Two things about the shape:
//
// ARM ALL, THEN WAIT. The end-to-end `transfer_single()` cannot be used here:
// it arms one channel and then blocks, so channel N+1 would not be armed until
// channel N had finished and there would be nothing to arbitrate. This is the
// case the model splits `transfer_single_start()` from `wait_completion()` for
// -- the split is not an implementation detail, it is what lets a test hold
// several operations in flight.
//
// THE WAITS ARE FORKED, one per channel, because each waits on its own
// channel's `wake` and reads its own CSR. `notify_irq()` posts to every
// channel, so all four wake on any interrupt; the three that are still
// running see PENDING and go back to sleep. Completion ORDER is therefore
// still the order the device completes them in, not the order the forks were
// created -- what a waiter reports is its own CSR, which only reads DONE after
// that channel has actually finished.
//
// Design: docs/uvm-op-layer-adoption.md §7.3.
