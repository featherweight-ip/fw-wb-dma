// ---- throughput / performance sequence -----------------------------------
// Repeatedly runs a single-channel block copy (channel 0, one chunk) back to
// back, WITHOUT scoreboard checks, until a wall-clock target elapses. Counts
// completed transfers + words so the test can report throughput. Registers are
// re-programmed every transfer (the engine writes back TXSZ/ADRx on completion)
// -- a realistic per-transfer driver loop, and `transfer_single()` is exactly
// that loop: configure, arm, wait.
//
// MIGRATED DELIBERATELY, not exempted. The operation layer is what a driver
// would use, so a throughput number measured through it is the more honest
// figure; and this is the only test that would notice if the layer were
// expensive. Baseline (raw register writes), 2026-08-12:
//
//   TLM       5408.0 xfers/s   1.384 Mword/s
//   SPL_XTOR   107.9 xfers/s   0.028 Mword/s
//
// Per-transfer bus traffic changes shape: the old loop did 5 writes plus, per
// wake, 2 INT_SRC reads and a CH_CSR read; this one does 6 writes (configure
// writes AM0/AM1 too) plus one CH_CSR read per wake. Fewer accesses, but the
// channel_c/mailbox handoff and the extra process add SV-side cost that shows
// up on the TLM view, where the number is a class-model figure rather than a
// bus figure.
//
